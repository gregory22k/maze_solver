# Maze Solver App

This is a maze solver application built with Python and Tkinter. The application utilizes a recursive method to solve the maze.

## Maze Solving Algorithm

The maze solver algorithm employs a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to find a solution path from the start cell to the goal cell.

## Implementation

The algorithm iteratively explores the maze until it finds a path from the start cell to the goal cell. Once a solution is found, it marks the path and completes the maze solving process.

## Dependencies

This application requires Python and Tkinter to be installed.

## How to Use

To use the maze solver app, simply run the Python script. The maze will be displayed, and you can watch as the algorithm navigates through it to find the solution. You can change the size of the maze simply by changing the `num_rows` and `num_cols` in the main function.
